## Introduction and Motivation
**Life Expectancy at Birth (LEB)** is the expected (in the statistical sense) number of years of life remaining at birth. There are great variations in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in 

> * Economic circumstances
> * Public health
> * Medical care 
> * Industrial pollution

The impact of AIDS is particularly notable on life expectancy in many African countries. The difference in life expectancy between men and women is also obvious. Therefore, we build this **Shiny App** to show the LEB of different country and gender.

## Features

Enter the gender and country you intrested in and get informed!

```{r echo=FALSE,results='asis',message=FALSE}
require(rCharts)
LEBmaleCat <- read.csv("./assets/data/LifeExpectancyAtBirth_male.csv")
LEBfemaleCat <- read.csv("./assets/data/LifeExpectancyAtBirth_female.csv")
LEBmaleCat$Year<-as.numeric(format(as.Date(as.character(LEBmaleCat$Date),format="%d/%m/%Y"),"%Y"))
LEBfemaleCat$Year<-as.numeric(format(as.Date(as.character(LEBfemaleCat$Date),format="%d/%m/%Y"),"%Y"))
LEBmaleCat$gender<- factor("male")
LEBfemaleCat$gender<- factor("female")

temp1<-subset(LEBmaleCat,LEBmaleCat$country=="United States",select=c("Year","Value","gender"))
    temp2<-subset(LEBfemaleCat,LEBfemaleCat$country=="United States",select=c("Year","Value","gender"))
    temp<- rbind(temp1,temp2)
    temp<-temp[order(c(temp$Year,temp$gender)),]
    names(temp)<-c("Year","Life Expectancy at Birth Value","gender")

hp1 <- hPlot(x = "Year", y = "Life Expectancy at Birth Value",group="gender", data = temp, type = "line")
hp1$print('chart1')
```
